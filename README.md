## 🗺️ My Learning Path

Here’s how I navigated through the world of frontend development — one concept at a time:

- 💡 **Web Fundamentals:** Understanding how the web works — clients, servers, localhost, and ports.  
- 🏗️ **HTML Structure:** Building the foundation of a webpage using headings, tables, and images.  
- 🧩 **Block vs Inline Elements:** Learning how elements behave in layouts.  
- 🎥 **Embedding Media:** Adding YouTube videos, Google Maps, and iframes.  
- 🎨 **CSS Basics:** Exploring selectors, colors, backgrounds, margins, and padding.  
- 🧭 **Flexbox & Grid:** Creating adaptable, structured layouts.  
- 📦 **Box Model & Gradients:** Controlling spacing, borders, and adding visual appeal.  
- ⚡ **Animations & Pseudo-Classes:** Making designs come alive with interactions.  
- 📱 **Responsive Web Design:** Making sites look great on all screen sizes.  
- 💎 **Bootstrap Framework:** Speeding up UI design with modern components.
